One of Apache Spark’s main goals is to make big data applications easier to write. 
Spark has always had concise APIs in Scala and Python, but its Java API was verbose due to the lack of function expressions. 
With the addition of lambda expressions in Java 8, we’ve updated Spark’s API to transparently support these expressions, while staying compatible with old versions of Java. 
This new support will be available in Apache Spark 1.0.
